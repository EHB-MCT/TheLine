#### [Login & Signup Implementation]
**Date**: 02/01/2025  
**Changes/Features Implemented**:  
- Implemented login and signup functionality.  

**Challenges**:  
- Managing user data effectively.  
- Ensuring secure and efficient data storage.  
- Integrating login and signup functionality with .NET backend.

#### [Leaderboard UI & Backend]
**Date**: 05/01/2025  
**Changes/Features Implemented**:  
- Implemented leaderboard UI in the game scene.  
- Created and integrated backend for storing and managing leaderboard data.  

**Challenges**:  
- Tracking player scores and times efficiently.  

**Outcome**: Goal partially achieved, but there is a bug where the highscore time doesn't appear on the first attempt; re-running the game is required to display the data.

---

#### [Player & Global Stats]
**Date**: 06/01/2025  
**Changes/Features Implemented**:  
- Added player statistics functionality.  
- Implemented global stats tracking for comparison across players.

üõ†Ô∏è **Development Progress**

#### [Feature 1: Drawing Line]  
**Description**: Implementing the ability to draw a line using the mouse.  
**Progress**: 80% complete  
**Issues**:  
1. A new line can be drawn from the starting point without restrictions.  
2. Once the line is released, it is not possible to continue drawing from the endpoint.  
**Solution**:  
1. Accepted the behavior of starting a new line from the beginning.  
2. Decided not to implement the feature for resuming the line from the endpoint after release.

#### [Feature 2: Obstacles]  
**Description**: Implemented obstacles into the game levels.  
**Progress**: 100% complete  
**Issues**:  
1. Perfecting collision detection between the line and obstacles.  
**Solution**:  
1. Worked with Polygon Collider 2D and rewrote scripts to improve accuracy of collision detection.

#### [Feature 3: Time Collectibles]  
**Description**: Time collectibles that allow you to reduce the registered time.  
**Progress**: 100% complete  
**Issues**: /  
**Solution**: / 

#### [Feature 4: Line Markers]  
**Description**: Implementing start and end points for the drawn line.  
**Progress**: 90% complete  
**Issues**:  
1. The line can only be drawn starting from the start point.  
2. Upon reaching the end point, the scene should transition to the next level.  
**Solution**:  
1. Utilized a `LineMarkersManager` script to manage the start and end points.  
2. Combined the `LineMarkersManager` script with a `LoadNextLevel` script to handle scene transitions.

#### [Feature 4: Leaderboard]
**Description**: Implementing a leaderboard system to track and display player rankings based on their game performance.  
**Progress**: 40% complete  
**Issues**:  
1. Highscore time doesn't display correctly on the first attempt. The leaderboard only updates after the game is re-run.  
**Solution**:  
1. Investigating potential fixes to ensure that highscore times display immediately after the first game session.

üìù **Roadmap**

- **Next Feature to be Added**: Camera that follows the mouse to make levels feel more dynamic.
- **Next Milestone**: adding time & date to the database.
- **Critical Bugs to be Fixed Before Next Release**: Fix timer display in Main Menu and resolve Leaderboard issues.
